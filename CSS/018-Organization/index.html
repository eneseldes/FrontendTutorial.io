                As you start to work on larger stylesheets and big projects you
                will discover that maintaining a huge CSS file can be
                challenging. In this article we will take a brief look at some
                best practices for writing your CSS to make it easily
                maintainable, and some of the solutions you will find in use by
                others to help improve maintainability.

            <div class="contentText">
              <p>
                Here are some general suggestions for ways to keep your
                stylesheets organized and tidy.

              Does your project have a coding style guide?
            </div>
            <div class="contentText">
              If you are working with a team on an existing project, the first
              thing to check is whether the project has an existing style guide
              for CSS. The team style guide should always win over your own
              personal preferences. There often isn't a right or wrong way to do
              things, but consistency is important.

            <br />
            <div class="contentTitle">Keep it consistent</div>
            <div class="contentText">
              If you get to set the rules for the project or are working alone,
              then the most important thing to do is to keep things consistent.
              Consistency can be applied in all sorts of ways, such as using the
              same naming conventions for classes, choosing one method of
              describing color, or maintaining consistent formatting. (For
              example, will you use tabs or spaces to indent your code? If
              spaces, how many spaces?) <br /><br />

              Having a set of rules you always follow reduces the amount of
              mental overhead needed when writing CSS, as some of the decisions
              are already made.

            <div class="contentTitle">Formatting readable CSS</div>
            <div class="contentText">
              <p>
                There are a couple of ways you will see CSS formatted. Some
                developers put all of the rules onto a single line, like so:
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="codeArea">
              <div class="codeContent">
                <pre>
                  .box {background-color: #567895; }
                  h2 {background-color: black; color: white; }
                </pre>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="contentText">
              <p>
                Other developers prefer to break everything onto a new line:
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="codeArea">
              <div class="codeContent">
                <pre>
                  .box {
                    background-color: #567895;
                  }
                  h2 {
                    background-color: black;
                    color: white;
                  }</pre
                >
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="contentText">
              <p>
                CSS doesn't mind which one you use. We personally find it is
                more readable to have each property and value pair on a new
                line.
              </p>

            <div class="contentText">
              <p>
                Adding comments to your CSS will help any future developer work
                with your CSS file, but will also help you when you come back to
                the project after a break.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="codeArea">
              <div class="codeContent">
                <pre>
                  /* This is a CSS comment
                  It can be broken onto multiple lines. */
                </pre>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="contentText">
              <p>
                A good tip is to add a block of comments between logical
                sections in your stylesheet too, to help locate different
                sections quickly when scanning it, or even to give you something
                to search for to jump right into that part of the CSS. If you
                use a string that won't appear in the code, you can jump from
                section to section by searching for it — below we have used
                <mark> || </mark>.
              </p>

                  /* || General styles */

                  /* … */

                  /* || Typography */

                  /* … */

                  /* || Header and Main Navigation */

                  /* … */</pre
                >

            </div>
            <div class="contentText">
              <p>
                You don't need to comment every single thing in your CSS, as
                much of it will be self-explanatory. What you should comment are
                the things where you made a particular decision for a reason.
              </p>

            <div class="contentTitle">Avoid overly-specific selectors</div>
            <div class="contentText">
              <p>
                If you create very specific selectors, you will often find that
                you need to duplicate chunks of your CSS to apply the same rules
                to another element. For example, you might have something like
                the below selector, which applies the rule to a
                <span class="item">&lt;p&gt;</span>
                with a class of <span class="item">box</span> inside an
                <span class="item">&lt;article&gt;</span> with a class of
                <span class="item">main</span> main.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="codeArea">
              <div class="codeContent">
                <pre>
                  article.main p.box {
                    border: 1px solid #ccc;
                  }
                </pre>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="contentText">
              <p>
                If you then wanted to apply the same rules to something outside
                of <span class="item">main</span>, or to something other than a
                <span class="item">&lt;p&gt;</span>, you would have to add
                another selector to these rules or create a whole new ruleset.
                Instead, you could use the selector
                <span class="item">.box</span> to apply your rule to any element
                that has the class <span class="item">box</span>:
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="codeArea">
              <div class="codeContent">
                <pre>
                  .box {
                    border: 1px solid #ccc;
                  }
                </pre>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="contentText">
              <p>
                There will be times when making something more specific makes
                sense; however, this will generally be an exception rather than
                usual practice.
